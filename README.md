# CSSI Environment Setup

For this year's CSSI Prework, we want to make sure that you are using all of the same technologies that your students will be using this summer. That means you'll need to sign up for several sites and have a few important pieces of software installed before you can jump in to learning.

1. [Sign up for Github](http://www.github.com) - Github is the 'Google Docs of Code'. You'll get very familiar with it over the next few weeks, but for now just sign up for an account.

2. [Download Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) - Homebrew is a *package manager* - that's a fancy way of saying that its a way to install, maintain and uninstall programs on your computer.

3. Once you've installed Homebrew, make sure that you have **git** installed. Type `brew install git`. Git is a version control system that allows you to save your work. Once downloaded, type `git config --global user.name "YOUR NAME"` (replacing YOUR NAME with your github username), and then `git config --global user.email "YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS"` (replacing YOUR EMAIL with the email associated with your github account)

4. Set up command line access to Github via SSH. That sounds complicated, but it's not. What this means is that we want to be able to use github from the terminal without typing in our username and password every time. To do this, follow these steps:

  a. [Set up SSH keys in the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
  b.[Add your SSH keys to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
  c.[Test your connection to GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/testing-your-ssh-connection/)

5. Download the [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io/). You'll learn more about this in the next readme.
